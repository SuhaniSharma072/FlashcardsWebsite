My project is called FlashcardsWebsite and it is study help website where you input questions and answers and you can flip the cards while studying to check your answer. I took inspiration from quizlet 
for making this as I regularly use quizlet to study for my tests. My project was made using Javascript,CSS, and HTML. I first struggled with making the cards interactive and flip to show the answers as I'm 
still improving my JS skills. I also forgot to input the link to styles.css on my index.html page so the visuals weren't showing up until I realized my mistake.
